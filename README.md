# Titanic Survival Insights

The Titanic Survival Insights project aims to analyze the Titanic dataset to uncover key factors influencing passenger survival during the infamous maritime disaster. By leveraging various data analysis and machine learning techniques, this project seeks to predict which passengers were more likely to survive based on their socio-economic status, age, gender, ticket fare, and other relevant features.

- **Independent Variables (x):** sex, age, sibsp, parch, fare, cabin, embarked, boat
- **Dependent Variable (y):** Survived (0 or 1)

We use **StandardScaler** for scaling the features and **DecisionTreeClassifier** for classification.
